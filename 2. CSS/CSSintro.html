    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Common cuttlefish are the largest found in UK seas and a fierce predator.
      They make light work of crabs, fish and even small cuttlefish! They live
      in water up to 200 metres deep but come to shallow waters to breed in
      spring. Their eggs are dyed black with cuttlefish ink, which gives them
      the appearance of grapes – giving them their name ‘sea grapes’. Cuttlefish
      usually live for two years and die after they have bred.

    <h2>How to identify</h2>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish are a chunky squid-like creature with a well-developed head,
      large eyes and mouths with beak-like jaws. They have a fin that runs
      around their body, eight 'arms' with suckers plus two tentacles around the
      mouth. Cuttlefish are extremely variable in colour, but are usually
      blackish-brown, mottled or striped. The cuttlebones found washed ashore
      are white, chalky and oval-shaped with thin harder 'wings' at one end.

      Found around all coasts of the UK, more common on south and west coasts.

    <h2>Did you know?</h2>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish can quickly change colour and texture to merge into their
      background, distract predators or attract mates. They can easily mimic
      different types of seabed and will sometimes even sink into a sandy seabed
      to hide from predators, leaving only their eyes exposed. During spring and
      summer, males engage in spectacular displays to attract females, passing
      pulses of colour rapidly along their bodies.
