      The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
      short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia
      around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat
      and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.

      Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered, and the wings are short.[17] Wild junglefowl can
      fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly
      more than a short distance.</p>

        [18] Size and coloration vary widely between
      breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their
      heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side
      under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in
      males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the
      face, giving the appearance of a beard.[19]

  <h2>Origin and dispersal</h2>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>
      Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the
      Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the
      Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds
      and their dinosaur relatives.[40] Chickens are descended primarily from
      the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as
      the same species.[41] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with
      populations of red junglefowl.[41] The domestic chicken has subsequently
      hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green
      junglefowl;[42] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated
      into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[43] It is
      estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red
      junglefowl.[42]
